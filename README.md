# OpenAgriS3D

This is a collection of parametric designs for agricultural applications to enable low-cost, sustainable and resilient farming practices.
Inspired by and a continuation of the paper: [Applications of Open Source 3-D Printing on Small Farms](https://doi.org/10.12924/of2015.01010019).

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of OpenSCAD designs for agricultural applications, focusing on small-scale organic farming. To get started and see what the library has to offer check out the [docs](docs/README.md).

The designs are grouped into five categories:

- [Animal Management](docs/animal-management.md)
- [Food Processing](docs/food-processing.md)
- [Hand Tools](docs/hand-tools.md)
- [Hydroponics](docs/hydroponics.md)
- [Plant Management](docs/plant_management.md)
- [Water Management](docs/water-management.md)

## Goals

The goal of this repository is to provide a platform for collaborative development and sharing of open-source 3D printed designs for sustainable agriculture. By leveraging distributed manufacturing and open-source technologies, we aim to reduce the economic costs of farming and promote self-sufficiency in rural communities.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a design or idea for a 3D printed agricultural tool or equipment, please submit a pull request or issue or email `cbrook49@uwo.ca` with a clear outline of your idea / need and I will try my best to help in a timely manner!

## Acknowledgements

This library would not be possible without the effort and creativity of the open source community, we have done our best to give proper attribution where it's owed but if we forgot anything please let us know and we will rectify the issue.
