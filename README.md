# OpenAgriS3D

A collection of parametric designs for agricultural applications to enable low-cost, sustainable and resilient farming practices.
Inspired by and a continuation of the paper: [Applications of Open Source 3-D Printing on Small Farms](https://doi.org/10.12924/of2015.01010019).

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of OpenSCAD designs for agricultural applications, focusing on small-scale organic farming. To get started and see what the library has to offer check out the [docs](docs/README.md).

The designs are grouped into five categories:

- [Hand Tools](docs/hand-tools.md)
- [Food Processing](docs/food-processing.md)
- [Animal Management](docs/animal-management.md)
- [Water Management](docs/water-management.md)
- [Hydroponics](docs/hydroponics.md)

## Goals

The goal of this repository is to provide a platform for collaborative development and sharing of open-source 3D printed designs for sustainable agriculture. By leveraging distributed manufacturing and open-source technologies, we aim to reduce the economic costs of farming and promote self-sufficiency in rural communities.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a design or idea for a 3D printed agricultural tool or equipment, please submit a pull request or issue or email `cbrook49@uwo.ca` with a clear outline of your idea / need and I will try my best to help in a timely manner!
