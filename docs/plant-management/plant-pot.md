### Optimizing Container Design for Vegetable Plant Growth

The OpenSCAD model also includes an optional definition for internal vertical walls (IVWs) based on the research paper [Container Design Affects Shoot and Root Growth of Vegetable Plant](https://doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI14954-20) which found that:

- The presence of internal walls increased the root surface area by 34% to 35%
- The presence of internal walls increased the biomass by 20%
- The presence of internal walls doubled or tripled the growth parameters of a shoot when subjected to drought stress
- The container morphology (circular vs. square) had little influence on the root surface and biomass
- The type of substrate (coir fiber or perlite) had little influence on the results

**Bottom line**: *Incorporating internal vertical walls in container design can significantly enhance vegetable plant growth, increasing root surface area, biomass, and drought stress tolerance, regardless of container shape or substrate type.*
